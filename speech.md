Speaklear app sample

[Aural Analytics](https://auralanalytics.com/) develops applications for monitoring brain health through changes in speech. I worked with their team in the early stages of development to create two app concepts for remote speech language therapy for patient and therapist, of which the therapist app was included as a finalist in the [2014 Vodafone Wireless Innovation Competition](https://vodafone-us.com/wireless-innovation-project/past-competitions/2014/2014-finalists/).
