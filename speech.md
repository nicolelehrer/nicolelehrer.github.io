[Aural Analytics](https://auralanalytics.com/) is developing mobile apps for speech therapy. I worked with their team in the early stages of development to create two app concepts for remote speech language therapy, one of which was included as a finalist in the [2014 Vodafone Wireless Innovation Competition](https://vodafone-us.com/wireless-innovation-project/past-competitions/2014/2014-finalists/).
