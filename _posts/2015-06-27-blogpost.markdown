There are two targets - one for your app's code and one for testing. 

Make any classes and corresponding methods/parameters you want accessible in your tests public, which requires adding a public before them

Or add you class to your test target 
by selecting your project file on the left, going to utilities on the right (right side pane) and specificing the tagret tests 




I read about class initialization 
https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/Initialization.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH18-ID203

Unlike Objective-C initializers, Swift initializers do not return a value. Their primary role is to ensure that new instances of a type are correctly initialized before they are used for the first time.
