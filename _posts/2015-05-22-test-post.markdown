Notes from May 26 - May 27

At Recurse Center (RC), so far I plan on focusing on IOS development, with a side-dish of experimenting in web-based interactive visuals. 

One of the RC facilitators introduced me to making a command line tool application using Xcode. I can write Objective-C code within the main loop of the program and spend some more time understanding what a chunk of code is doing before worrying about more complex things, like the app's life cycle. 

I'm just getting started on learning how to request data from the web - this short [example](https://github.com/nicolelehrer/MyCommandLineTool) asks you to enter a web url in the console, and then grabs and displays the page content. Next I'm going to look into how to parse things to do something more useful. 

I attended a short Git seminar, during which the RC facilitator started a simple JS game I'm hoping to make some basic contributions to, along with the other attendees, really just to better understand how to work on a project collaboratively. I've been using Git since January, but mainly just to version control and backup my own work. 

I met with some other RC'ers to talk about their experience in [D3.js](http://d3js.org), a library for making data visualizations among other things in the browser. While I hadn't heard of D3.js before, in the past I have [tried to make a basic WebGL scene](https://github.com/nicolelehrer/ThreeJSIntro) using [three.js](http://threejs.org). (I've been meaning to look at this [fundamentals of WebGL link](http://webglfundamentals.org) for a while now too.) Once I decide on a toy project, I'll choose which library to use, but I have a feeling I might start with D3 since so many others expressed interest, giving me more chances to pair program.
