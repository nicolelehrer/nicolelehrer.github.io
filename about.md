I'm interested in mobile app design and development for interactive health and creative tools. 

I recently attended [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) (FKA Hacker School) in NYC, a self-directed retreat for programmers.

Before that I was working on my Ph.D. in Media Arts and Sciences at the [School of Arts, Media and Engineering](http://ame.asu.edu) at [ASU](http://www.asu.edu) as part of the [NSF Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship](http://www.igert.org). As a member of the Mixed Reality Rehabilitation lab at ASU, I worked on interactive systems for stroke rehabilitation, with a focus on feedback development. You can find my dissertation [here](http://repository.asu.edu/items/26862).

Before grad school, I studied Biomedical Engineering and Painting at [Tulane University](http://tulane.edu). [Here's](/painting/) some work from my BFA show and a few more recent sketches.
