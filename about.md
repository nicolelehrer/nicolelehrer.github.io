I'm currently working with the [Signal Analysis, Representation, and Perception (SARP) Group](https://chs.asu.edu/research/human-cognition/signal-analysis-representation-and-perception-sarp-laboratory) at ASU on developing mobile apps for unsupervised speech therapy.  

I recently finished my Ph.D. in Media Arts and Sciences in the [School of Arts, Media and Engineering](http://ame.asu.edu) at [Arizona State University](http://www.asu.edu). I was a member of the [Mixed Reality Group for Stroke Rehabilitation](http://ame2.asu.edu/projects/mrrehab/), where I worked with a diverse team on systems for interactive neurorehabilitation for stroke. 

Before moving to Tempe for grad school, I studied painting and biomedical engineering at [Tulane University](http://tulane.edu) in my hometown, New Orleans.
