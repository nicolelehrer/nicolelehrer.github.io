Graduate work in interactive neurorehabilitation 
========================= 

The [Mixed Reality Group for Stroke Rehabilitation](http://research.ame.asu.edu/projects/mrr) is a group of collaborators across [ASU](http://www.asu.edu), [CMU](http://www.cmu.edu/academics/) and [Emory](http://med.emory.edu) focused on designing interactive systems for upper extremity stroke rehabilitation. Two systems have been developed so far, one for clinical supervised training and another for home-based semi-supervised training.

I developed a visual summary of trajectory error for the clinical system, the visual feedback environment for the home-based system, and an iPad app to assist the clinician in discussing progress with the stroke survivor. My contributions to these projects were also used to illustrate a media design methodology for experiential media systems, informed by multiple disciplines and described in my [dissertation](http://repository.asu.edu/items/26862).

Training Monitoring iPad App
======

The Training Monitoring iPad app was designed for use by the physical therapist during weekly visits for patients engaged in unsupervised training, and can be used to administer and video-record multiple standardized tasks. Once video is recorded, the therapist can segment videos into individual reaches, and tag those reaches with an overall quality label and detailed comments. The tagged videos are stored in a bank the therapist uses for composing a video story on the participantâ€™s progress and areas for improvement. Each week the therapist can select from any of the past videos that were tagged to arrange them into an updated video story.
