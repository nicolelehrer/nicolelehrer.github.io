	<h2>About me</h2>
	
	<p>
Currently I'm in graduate school at Arizona State University pursuing a Ph.D. in Media Arts and Sciences. My research focuses on developing interactive visual media for stroke rehabilitation, with a focus on retraining upper extremity movement of stroke survivors. Before grad school, I attended Tulane University from 2003-2008 to study painting and biomedical engineering.

	<p>
My future research and development interests lie in mobile apps for creativity. I'm a big fan of <em>Paper</em> by <em>53</em> and <em>Figure</em> by <em>Propellerhead</em>.
