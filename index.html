	<p>I'm very excited to be attending the Summer 1 batch at the <a href=https://www.recurse.com>Recurse Center</a> in NYC. Check back for blog posts.</p> 

	<p>I recently finished my Ph.D. in Media Arts and Sciences in the <a href="http://ame.asu.edu">School of Arts, Media and Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.asu.edu">Arizona State University</a>, where I worked on interactive systems for stroke neurorehabilitation in the <a href="http://research.ame.asu.edu/projects/mrr">Mixed Reality Rehabilitation Group</a>.</p>

	<p>Before grad school, I studied <a href="/painting">painting</a> and biomedical engineering at <a href="http://tulane.edu">Tulane University</a> in my hometown <a href=http://www.neworleanssaints.com> New Orleans.</a> </p>
